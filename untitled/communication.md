# Communication



We're an [all-remote](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/#advantages-for-organizations) company that allows people to work from a lot of different places, so it's important for us to practice clear communication in ways that help us stay connected and work more efficiently.

### \#All Hands

We meet regularly \(currently twice a week on Mondays and Thursdays\) to get together as a company and discuss things that are important to the entire company. This includes a round robin where each team member gets a chance to talk about their personal lives outside of work.

### \#Meetings

Key practices to consider during any meeting are listed below.

1. **1-Minute Start** - Internal meetings start 1 minute after the calendar start time \(10:30am meeting starts at 10:31am\) regardless of who is/isn’t in the meeting yet. Late participants understand this and expect to join a meeting already in progress \(but external forces likely caused their delay, which is ok!\).
2. **Video Calls** - If this is your first time meeting a customer/prospect/partner/etc., turn on your camera when you log in to Zoom. This will help to make the customer/prospect feel more comfortable as they are certain your undivided attention is geared towards them.
3. **Agenda** - Always have an agenda prepped and ready to go, usually as a Google Doc. Share this with your audience, usually by attaching to the meeting invite. Make sure all participants have edit rights. Make sure that everything on the agenda is accurate and ask if there’s anything missing that needs to be addressed during this call or for the future. When there is no agenda, it translates to you not caring. When sharing agendas with customers and partners it should be called "Replicated + Name Shared Collaboration & Agenda", not "External Agenda" as that implies there is something the parties are not seeing.
4. **Take Notes** - Effective note-taking is a valuable skill that will help you retain and recall any important details, as well as share them with other people that weren’t in the meeting. Take notes directly in the Agenda doc. Encourage everyone to contribute in realtime.
   1. _Tip: Please take notes for the person talking and share this responsibility so everyone can contribute to the conversation._
5. **End on time** - Consider using the ‘speedy meeting’ setting when scheduling calls.
   1. Calls end at :25 mins after to leave a break between meetings. This gives everyone at least 5 mins to take a short break and be ready on time for their next call.

### \#Slack

#### \#General

* In general, channels should be public \(not private\), unless you have a good reason not to.
* When a channel name consists of multiple words, use a `-` between words. So `#peer-review` and not `#peer_review`.
* The following channels are automatically joined for everyone:
  * `#announcements`, `#general, #random, #thanks`
* Recommended:
  * `#office`
  * `#trophies`
  * `#cfp`
* Social
  * `#dogs`, `#cats`, `#cooking`, `#movies`, ...

#### \#Sales / CS / SE

* Default: `#customer-eng`, `#bizness-chat`
* Channels that are shared with customers are named with the customer name only, e.g. `#puppet`. The customer can and should name the channel differently, probably `#replicated`.
* Channels that are used to discuss a customer, but are internal only are named like `#[vendor]-internal`. E.g. `#puppet-internal`.
* Channels with a double diamond shape are shared with external users \(from a company outside of Replicated\)!

#### \#Marketing

Default: \#marketing, \#product-marketing

#### \#Product / Engineering

* Default: \#product, \#engineering, \#competition
* Team-specific:
  * \#day0
  * \#day1
  * \#day2
  * \#tech-writing
* Project- and product-specific:
  * \#kots
  * \#kurl
  * \#troubleshoot
  * \#vendorweb
  * \#download\_portal
  * \#ship
  * \#frontend
* Others:
  * \#marketing
  * \#product-marketing
  * \#[bizness-chat](https://replicated.slack.com/archives/C29MM1G5T) \(sales/cs/ce/marketing/operations\)
  * \#customer-eng
  * \#community
  * \#codeserver
  * \#[support-chat](https://replicated.slack.com/archives/C0PHDRHJ9) \(support\)

#### \#Recruiting

* There’s a public `#recruiting` channel for general recruiting discussions. Other than scheduling, specific candidates should not be discussed here. Keep candidate feedback in Lever.
* Some hiring managers create \#recruiting-\[job\] private channels to discuss specific candidates or offers. E.g. `#recruiting-pm`.
* Any discussions about specific candidates should be kept in a private channel like `#discuss_candidate_grantmiller` or better yet, entirely tracked in Lever.

#### \#Tips

* You can organize your channels in different sections: [howtogeek](https://www.howtogeek.com/666915/how-to-create-new-sections-to-group-channels-in-slack/)
* View all your [unread messages](https://slack.com/help/articles/226410907-View-all-your-unread-messages)
* Prefer to use a public channel for discussion rather than DMs, even group DMs. If you need to add someone to a discussion after, if it’s a channel, you can just invite them. If it’s a group DM, you have to start another group DM and repeat a bunch of info. Even if you create the public channel and then archive it 20 minutes later when the discussion is done, that’s a better pattern. Of course, it is usually even better to simply @ mention the people and put the question/topic in an existing public channel.
* Prefer adding people to a Slack channel using the “Add people to XYZ” icon, rather than @ mentioning them to avoid clutter other people.
* When adding someone to a conversation or thread, you can @ mention them, but even better is to put some context in the comment so when they get notified, they see something more meaningful than `@you ^^`.

* Link your calendar: [https://slack.com/app-pages/google-calendar](https://slack.com/app-pages/google-calendar)

#### \#Why “Slack naming conventions”

* It all started with 2 SE’s discussing which channel names to use for customer/vendor shared channels, and internal ones. And always having to check twice before sending a message!
* This doc is especially useful when joining Replicated.
